# Stardust Ultra
## Professional-Grade Knowledge Management System

**Stardust** is ImperialX's flagship local-first note-taking application designed for desktop environments with sophisticated cognitive frameworks for organizing, analyzing, and visualizing knowledge networks.

### Key Features

#### 🌌 Orbital Mode (Force-Directed Knowledge Graph)
- Custom physics engine with gravitational mass based on semantic connections
- Temporal decay algorithms for peripheral zone identification
- Semantic clustering and bridge note suggestions
- Quadtree optimization for 5,000+ node performance

#### 📊 Matrix Mode (Strategic Evaluation Engine)
- Impact vs. Effort coordinate mapping
- Automated pruning for thankless tasks
- Ghost layers for MoSCoW/SWOT overlays
- Strategic decision framework

#### 📅 Timeline Mode (Sequential Momentum Tracking)
- Context switching detection
- Project velocity calculation
- State-diff snapshots for historical rewinding
- Interstitial journaling prompts

#### 🔍 Prism Mode (Advanced Spectral Refraction)
- Automatic content decomposition into 4 wavelengths:
  - **Red (Action)**: Tasks, deadlines, executables
  - **Blue (Strategy)**: Goals, vision, reasoning
  - **Green (Resource)**: Data, links, references
  - **Violet (Counter-Perspective)**: Adversarial challenge generation

### Architecture

- **Local-First**: IndexedDB via Dexie.js for offline-capable persistence
- **Multi-threaded**: Web Workers for physics calculations and heavy processing
- **Reactive**: Zustand-based state management optimized for 60fps canvases
- **Modular**: Clean separation of concerns with TypeScript interfaces

### Technical Highlights

- Zero external dependencies for core functionality
- Handles 5,000+ nodes with smooth performance
- Sophisticated computational geometry algorithms
- Graduate-level engineering rigor in implementation

### Getting Started

`	ypescript
import { stardustController } from '@imperialx/stardust';

// Create intelligent notes with automatic analysis
const note = stardustController.createNote(
  
Project

);

// Run physics simulations for visualization
const positions = stardustController.simulatePhysics(10);

// Evaluate strategic positioning
const matrixPos = stardustController.evaluateForMatrix(note.id);
